# Today I learned:
Monday:
Man did we cover a lot!  I think I understand maybe 10% after lecture, 30% after reading and maybe 70% after re-going over.  
- literal objects
- this.property
- DOMs
- innerHTML

Tuesday:
Constructors were not quite as difficult as I thought they would be.  102 probably helped plant the seed plus sam's demos really helped build step by step.  Took a while to get my Table working.  Dale helped me and Ryan work through it. partway through his help I realized I hadn't added my script tag because we didn't need it yesterday.
- Constructors
- Tables

Wednesday:
Lots of review, expanded info on index.  learned by watching Sam about HTML building with auto complete using tab or enter.

Thursday:
Ok so making the form was not that bad.  getting the form to work with the table didn't work too well.  almost wanted to rewrite whole js file.  hopefully I understand better tomorrow.
